2023,Fall,2023-fa,ARTD,230,Design Thinking/Need-Finding,"Design thinking, a term with origins in industrial design practice, describes a human-centered approach to design and innovation in products and services, addressing the tri-partite requirements of feasibility, desirability and viability. With this focus on determining user needs, a variety of processes, including observation, empathy, ideation, prototyping and modeling, are used to discover people's needs and opportunities for design thinking, along with the communication of design outcomes by diagrammatic and narrative means. Design thinking is best done in teams, hence the project team basis for this course. This course concentrates on need-finding rather than the full resolution of design proposals. Same as TE 230.

2023,Fall,2023-fa,ENGL,259,Early African American Literature and Culture,"An introduction to the study of early African American literary and cultural production, ranging from the earliest writings by African descended people in British North America in the eighteenth century to the end of World War I. At each turn, we will situate texts in their cultural and historical contexts, attending not only to the specificity of a particular text's moment, but also to the forces of contingency and tradition at play in the construction of literary, cultural, and political communities. Throughout our discussions we will think about both the ""African-ness"" and ""American-ness"" of African American literature as collective and imaginative processes. Early African Americans wrote for a variety of reasons—philosophical, political, pleasurable, instrumental—and protesting slavery and racism was just one (albeit an important one) among many of those reasons. We will read letters, poems, sermons, songs, constitutions and bylaws for religious and civic organizations, stories, and texts that defy easy categorization. Writers may include Phillis Wheatley, David Walker, Maria Stewart, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, Frances E.W. Harper, William Wells Brown, W.E.B.
